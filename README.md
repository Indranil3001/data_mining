# 📊 Recommendation System – Data Mining Project

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **recommendation system** as part of a **data mining coursework assignment**.  
The notebook explores how user–item interaction data can be analyzed and transformed into meaningful recommendations using classical recommendation system techniques.

The focus is on **understanding the underlying concepts**, implementing them from scratch where possible, and evaluating their behavior on real or semi-real datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of recommendation systems
- Apply **data mining techniques** to user–item data
- Implement and analyze recommendation algorithms
- Evaluate recommendation quality using appropriate metrics

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Techniques
The notebook covers concepts and/or implementations related to:

- Content-Based Filtering
- Collaborative Filtering  
  - User–User similarity  
  - Item–Item similarity
- Similarity measures (e.g. cosine similarity, correlation)
- Basic recommendation ranking logic
